# Embedded Systems Fundamentals - code along
This is a collection of files related to my reading of "Embedded Systems Fundamentals with Arm Cortex-M based Mircocontrollers".
The instructions in the book are writting for a NUCLEO-F091RC, however when I ordered the part the supplier sent me the wrong board. 
I had a NUCLEO-L073RZ board sitting on my desk so decided that I woud try to follow along with that instead. The results have been varied but the depth of education has been far greater than if I had followed along with the original board.
